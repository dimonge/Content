  Engineer with business instinct and currently looking for new ways to solve problem with deep learning.

10 year old Peter said that one day, he will change the way the world. 17 years later, he is still that journey, but closer than ever. This blog will serve all the new ideas, products and different activities that am current working on.

Over next couple of years, I will be working on new concepts in my new company "TheVineLabs". TheVineLabs is a new research lab that will include me and myself, but I will be looking to grow the team in the near future. So stay tuned. I will be writing about the journey on my blog before things becomes official.

As for myself, An enthusiasts Engineer who someday will influence the way we interact with one another and with things around us.

If you want to discuss about my passion or you wish to join in, you can send a message at petershodeinde4@gmail.com

Thanks for reading and let the journey continue!
