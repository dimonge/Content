In 2008, I started my journey when I started an University program in Information Technology. Moving to finland was a big step for me as an 18 year old who has not travelled outside of Nigeria, but it was an interesting challenge that I was willing to take. 

During the study period, in developed interest for programming. To me, it was difficult but I found the challenge pretty exciting. I tried the easy road of Networking (CCNA and Telecom networking) in the first and second year. Then I finally decide to take the high road, and move back to software development that learning because it allowed me to craft my own imaginations (so the mastering the craft is a lifelong journey). 

Worked in Conmio, Seven Networks, Consultant (in a startup that didn't fly), PlanMill
